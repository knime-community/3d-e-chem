    <shortDescription>
        Subfamily specific two entropy analysis score.
    </shortDescription>
    
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>Calculates ss-TEA score of sequence alignment and subfamily members.<br />
        <p />
	Calculates entropies of each column/residue position in the sequence alignment.
	The entropy is calculated twice once for members inside the subfamily and once for members outside the subfamily.
	The ss-TEA score is a distance which is low when entropy within subfamily is low and entropy outside subfamily is high.<br/>
	So positions with the lowest ss-TEA scores are most likely to be involved in ligand binding within the selected subfamily.<br/> 
        <p />
	The ss-TEA can identify specific ligand binding residue positions for any receptor, predicated on high quality sequence information.
