KNIME node to calculate subfamily specific two entropy analysis (ss-TEA) score.

The ss-TEA can identify specific ligand binding residue positions for any receptor, predicated on high quality sequence information.

See reference at https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-12-332 for a description of the score.
