# knime-silicosit

KNIME nodes and example workflows for software made by [Silicos-it](http://silicos-it.be.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/index.html) like shape-it to align molecules based on shape and align-it to align molecules based on their pharmacophore. Nodes can only be run on either Linux or OSX. The Silicos-it Windows binaries do not exist so the Silicos-it KNIME nodes are not available for WIndows aswell.
