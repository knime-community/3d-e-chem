If you are using KNIME workflows with large molecules and you want to view them in 3D then the molviewer nodes are able to handle this.
* Provides cheminformatics trying to model proteins within KNIME a way to view them
* Adds nodes to KNIME to visualize proteins, small molecules and pharmacophores
* Adds support to KNIME to  handle viewing big molecules
* Used to compare pharmacophore generation tools
* Used to check ligand repurposing

This project uses a web user interface based on https://github.com/3D-e-Chem/molviewer-tsx .
